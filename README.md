# Mind map of AWS Launches Q4 2020

### Frequently Asked Questions

##### Q. What is this?

A.
This is a mind map of significant AWS launches through Q4 2020 including the launches around re:Invent 2020. It excludes the regional launch notifications saying an existing service is now available in region X. It should include virtually everything else. This is an opinionated document produced by an AWS Solutions Architect, it isn't an official AWS marketing document.

##### Q. Who made it?

A. 
This was produced by Rob Charlton, Solutions Architect in AWS Global Financial Services.

##### Q. Why did you make this?

A. 
I produced a similar mind map for re:Invent 2019 in order to illustrate to my customer the scale and breadth of the launches we had made. I shared it and it proved popular so I thought I would do it again.

##### Q. Can I share this?

A.
Please re-share the copy from my LinkedIn, here <todo>. 

##### Q. How did you make this?

A.
This was made by hand. I went through the launches here: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/ and added the ones I thought were interesting for roughly Q4 2020. I used [XMind 8](https://www.xmind.net/download/xmind8) to create the map. I added links to all the launch blog posts as notes.

##### Q. Is it automated / do you have a scraping tool?

A.
No, sadly not. I started writing a scraper in Python last year. I was aiming to create a web site that could generate the mind map but it looked like the javascript view to draw the map would take a lot of work.

##### Q. Where are the links to the launch items?

A.
You need to open the map in XMind, then click on the yellow document icons next to each leaf node.

##### Q. Where do I get XMind?

A.
You can download it for free here: https://www.xmind.net/download/xmind8
